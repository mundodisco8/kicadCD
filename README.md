# kicadCD

kicadCD circleCI's orb, an orb to help automating the generation of production files for KiCad projects. It uses Kiplot to get Gerbers and other PCB "plots" and KiBoM to generate the bill of materials.

## v0.1.0 (24/10/2019)

First release of the orb. Not really intented for general use as it's pretty much WIP and will probably will change a lot in the short term. It can generate Gerbers with Kiplot and the positions file for the pick and place. It doesn't generate BoMs yet, but that will hopefully added soon.
